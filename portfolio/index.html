            <h3>Forex Blog: Market Insights & Trading Education</h3>
            <p>I developed this Forex Blog as a comprehensive online resource dedicated to providing clear, accessible market analysis and educational content for forex traders. My goal was to demystify currency markets and offer actionable insights, featuring articles on technical analysis, trading strategies, and daily market updates. The platform is designed for an intuitive user experience across all devices.</p>

            <p>
                The blog was built using  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React for a responsive and interactive user interface, coupled with  Backend Tech, e.g., Node.js/Express for robust content management and dynamic features. I was responsible for the full-stack development, including UI/UX design, database architecture using  MySQL] and integrating essential features like categorized content and a search function.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project allowed me to significantly enhance my skills in  full-stack development, API integration, responsive design while deepening my understanding of financial content presentation. It demonstrates my ability to create functional, informative, and user-friendly web applications.

            <h3>AgriConnect: AI-Powered Agricultural Marketplace</h3>
            <p>
                 I developed AgriConnect, an innovative AI-powered web platform designed to revolutionize the agricultural supply chain by directly connecting farmers with potential buyers. This project addresses market inefficiencies by providing farmers with a direct channel to showcase their produce and buyers with a streamlined way to source goods, ultimately fostering better economic opportunities for rural communities.
            </p>

            <p>
                The platform leverages AI algorithms to match supply with demand, optimize pricing strategies, and provide personalized recommendations based on user behavior. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React for the front end, and Node.js/Express for the back end, the application ensures a seamless user experience across devices. I was responsible for the entire development process, including UI/UX design, database management with Postgres SQL  and integrating AI functionalities.
            </p>

            <p>
                AgriConnect showcases my ability to integrate advanced AI/ML capabilities into a robust web application to solve real-world problems. This project significantly honed my skills in AI/ML integration, full-stack development, data modeling  and highlights my commitment to leveraging technology for social and economic impact.

            <h3>QR Code Generator: Instant Data Encoding Tool</h3>
            <p>
                I developed a straightforward and efficient QR Code Generator, a web-based utility that allows users to instantly convert various types of data—such as URLs, text, contact information, or Wi-Fi credentials—into scannable QR codes. This project focuses on providing a quick, reliable, and user-friendly tool for generating custom QR codes for a wide range of applications.
            </p>

            <p>
                The generator was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React to create an intuitive interface, allowing users to input data and customize code appearance. It leverages a  JavaScript QR code library, a backend API for generation to encode the data into a high-quality, downloadable QR image. My primary role involved designing the user interface, implementing the data input and validation, and integrating the QR code generation logic to ensure functionality and ease of use.
