    <h1>Welcome to my First Webpage</h1>
    <p>Hello there! This is my first proper webpage, and I’m pretty excited to build even more awesome stuff from here on out.</p>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This page was created as part of my portfolio project. It’s a simple start</p>

    <h3>Why I’m Learning Web Development</h3>
    <p>I’m learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create beautiful, functional, and interactive websites that can make real-world impact.</p>
    <p>Eventually, I’ll expand into Web3 development — blending creativity, finance, and technology into one exciting career path.
